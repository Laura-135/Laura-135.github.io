            <li> Moths have spooky spots on their wings and i like to paint spots on my nails </li>
            <li> Moths stay up at night, and i stay up way too late as well  </li>
            <li> Moths are usually brown, beige, pink (dark colours) which are colours i often wear</li>
            <li> Bugs typically enjoy nature (including moths), which is something we have in common</li>
