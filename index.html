        <em>...I would probably be a moth</em>
      </h1>    
      <ol>
        <li> Moths have spooky spots on their wings and i like to paint spots on my nails </li>
        <li> Moths stay up at night, and i stay up way too late as well  </li>
        <li> Moths are usually brown, beige, pink (dark colours) which are colours i often wear</li>
        <li> Bugs typically enjoy nature (including moths), which is something we have in common</li>
      </ol>
